# Gilded_rose
test project with gilded rose example

When creating a solution for the exercise I had several questions.
based on what the answers to those questions are i made a few different cases.

Questions like:
-What is the budget/time for this project/change?
-Is this a one time change or do we expect more changes like these?
-I am in the first place a tester, so do we need extra functionality to allow unit test/automated tests?
-Are the new 'conjured' items just called 'conjured' or do each of them have a different name starting with 'conjured', or...?
-Aged Brie only increases in quality, does that imply that it does not have a SellIn value?
-Will the goblin in the corner allow me to change the Item class a bit if I buy them a drink?
